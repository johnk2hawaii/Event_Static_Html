          <h1>Founder, Problem Solver, And Part-Time Cosmic Space Warrior</h1>
          <h2>Dr. John Koblanski</h2>
          <p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; margin-top: 25px">
            Dr. John Koblanski began his academic journey with a joint major in mathematics and physics and a minor in chemistry, followed by a master’s degree in theoretical physics from the University of Northern British Columbia. After an initial career transition into investment advising,
            he returned to academia to complete a Ph.D. in particle physics at the University of Hawai‘i,
            subsequently holding a postdoctoral research position. Throughout his career,
            spanning both academia and the private sector,
            Dr. Koblanski has been a pioneer in applying machine learning to fundamental physics.
            He has authored several highly cited publications in leading scientific journals,
            contributed to the design and testing of advanced detector systems,
            and co-founded Ultralytics LLC—now the world’s leading platform for computer vision technologies.

          <h2>Dr. Jasper Taylor</h2>
          <p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; margin-top: 25px">
            Dr. Jasper Taylor received his PhD from the University Of Hawaii in 2021 where he specialized in quantum computing.
            He is drawn to solving challenging problems, and loves to push himself past his limits and into the unknown.
            The feeling he gets from accomplishing something out of hisd comfort zone is addictive and is something that he craves.
            While his passion for tackling tough challenges fuels his professional drive, he also holds a deep appreciation for
            creating fun in his life and the lives of those around him. For him, bringing a sense of enjoyment to
            the team and to the world transforms the routine into the delightful.
            After all, humanity has advanced, when it has advanced, not because it has been responsible,
            and cautious, but because it has been playful, and rebellious.
