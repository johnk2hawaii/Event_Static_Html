          <h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 25px">Physicist, AI Architect, Relentless Problem Solver, and Mediocre Golfer</h2>
          <p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; margin-top: 25px">
            Dr. John Koblanski completed his Ph.D. in particle physics at the University of Hawai‘i after helping build the world's smallest
            antineutrino detector. Throughout his career,
            spanning both academia and the private sector,
            Dr. Koblanski has been a pioneer in applying machine learning to fundamental physics and industry.
            He has authored several highly cited publications in leading scientific journals,
            contributed to the design and testing of advanced detector systems,
            and co-founded Ultralytics LLC—now the world’s leading platform for computer vision technologies. John is not a gambler, but for some
            reason he loves losing money in golf. No wait, no he doesn't. Why you have money? Wanna play? 100 dollars a hole let's gooooo!

          <h1 style="font-size: 2.0em;">Chief Science Officer: Dr. Jasper Taylor</h1>
          <h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 25px">Physicist, Software Engineer, ML Engineer, and Puzzle Connoisseur</h2>
          <p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; margin-top: 25px">
            Dr. Jasper Taylor received his PhD from the University Of Hawaii in 2021 where he specialized in quantum computing.
            He is drawn to solving challenging problems, and loves to push himself past his limits and into the unknown.
            The feeling he gets from accomplishing something out of hisd comfort zone is addictive and is something that he craves.
            While his passion for tackling tough challenges fuels his professional drive, he also holds a deep appreciation for
            creating fun in his life and the lives of those around him. For him, bringing a sense of enjoyment to
            the team and to the world transforms the routine into the delightful.
            After all, humanity has advanced, when it has advanced, not because it has been responsible,
            and cautious, but because it has been playful, and rebellious.
